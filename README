PyPaste
===============

An encrypted pastebin written in python using flask.

#Features

- Encrypts all pasted data with AES-256-CBC on the clientside, so the service provider can't snoop into your pastes
- Pastes are stored on the harddisk, so no database is needed
- Keys are stored in location.hash, thus not transmitted to the server
- "Burn after reading":  Deletes a paste after the first visit
- Automatic expiration: User can choose how long the paste is valid
- Syntaxhighlighting: Highlightjs does the job
- Awesome Bootstrap design ;)
- Size-limit: Provider can limit a paste's size
- Expiration-limit: Provider can limit the expiration limit
- W3C compliant
- Built-in webserver
